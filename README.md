Description: The data and matlab scripts necessary to recreate the contrast sensitivity plots in Figures 2-5 of Intoy, Mostofi, & Rucci, 2021 in PNAS (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101259118).

Each of the scripts (Figure2B.m, Figure2CDE.m, Figure3.m, Figure4.m, and Figure5.m) loads the appropriate data from one of the .mat file to produce the figure panels.

Note that Figure2B.m requires an additional matlab toolbox (psignifit, Wichmann & Hill, 2001) which can be downloaded from https://github.com/wichmann-lab/psignifit.
